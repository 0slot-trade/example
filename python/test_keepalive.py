HTTP Keep-Alive Explained
HTTP Keep-Alive is a mechanism that allows multiple HTTP requests/responses to be sent and received over a single TCP connection, rather than establishing a new connection for each request/response.

Basic Principles
Without Keep-Alive:
1. The client establishes a TCP connection with the server.
2. The client sends an HTTP request.
3. The server returns an HTTP response.
4. The TCP connection is closed.
5. The next request requires re-establishing a TCP connection.

With Keep-Alive:
1. The client establishes a TCP connection with the server.
2. The client sends HTTP Request 1.
3. The server returns HTTP Response 1.
4. The connection remains open.
5. The client sends HTTP Request 2.
6. The server returns HTTP Response 2.
... (can continue reusing the connection)
7. The connection is eventually closed.

Main Advantages
- Reduces TCP handshake overhead: Avoids the three-way handshake required to establish a new TCP connection for each request.
- Mitigates the impact of TCP slow start: Reusing an existing connection bypasses the TCP slow start phase.
- Reduces system resource consumption: Decreases the number of simultaneously open connections.
- Improves page load speed: Particularly beneficial for web pages requiring multiple resources.

About 0slot.trade
The maximum duration for a 0slot.trade keep is 65 seconds. It is recommended to perform an access approximately every 60 seconds.
This access is unrestricted in contentâ€”any request and any response will not affect the Keep-Alive.
For SDKs: You can call the RPC method getHealth, which will return a correct "OK."
For manual HTTP access: You can execute a GET request or omit the apk-key. The advantage is that this access does not count toward TPS calculations.

getHealth refers to the official HTTP RPC method provided by Solana.
